Request Routing Plugin for Ruby on Rails
========================================
(c) Dan Webb 2006 (dan@vivabit.com)

Plugin that allows you to define routing conditions that test 
methods/properties of the request object such as subdomain, domain,
port.  You can test them either against a value or with a Regexp
(assuming the method returns a string)

*UPDATE* Now works with the new routing code as implemented in edge rails.  Note the
change in API: use :conditions instead of :requirements.

== Installation

    ruby script/plugin install http://svn.vivabit.net/external/rubylibs/request_routing/

== Usage

In routes.rb you can specify use the :requirements hash with request properties:

    map.connect '', :controller => 'main', :conditions => { :subdomain => 'www' }

    map.connect 'admin', :controller => 'admin', :conditions => { :remote_ip => /^127\.0\.0\.[0-9]$/ }

You can also, of course, use the conditions hash in map.with_options calls.

The allowed properties are:

		:subdomain  (only checks the first subdomain)
		:domain (only accurate for single tld domain names at the moment)
		:method (a symbol)
		:port (a number)
		:remote_ip 
		:content_type (content type of the post body)
		:accepts 
		:request_uri (the entire request uri)
		:protocol (either http:// or https://)
