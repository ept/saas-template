Dear <%= @user.name %>,

We received a request on <%= Rails::configuration.domain_name %> for your password to be reset. <% -%>
No problem -- everybody forgets theirs from time to time. Glad that you came back.

In order to reset your password, please click the following link:
<%= token_url @token %>

If you did not request a password reset, somebody else probably entered your email address <% -%>
on the <%= Rails::configuration.domain_name %> log-in page. If that is the case, please delete this email.
